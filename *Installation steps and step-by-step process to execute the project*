***Installation steps and step-by-step process to execute the project***

Install Power BI Desktop:
Download Power BI Desktop from the official Microsoft website.
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Data Sources and Data Preparation:
Prepare your data in a suitable format (CSV, Excel, SQL database, etc.).
Ensure that your data sources are accessible and organized.
Import Data into Power BI:

Launch Power BI Desktop.
Click on "Get Data" and select the appropriate data source (e.g., CSV, Excel, database).
Connect to your data source and import the relevant datasets.

Step-by-Step Process:
Now, let's break down the project execution into a step-by-step process:

Data Modeling:
After importing your data, you'll need to create relationships between tables if your data is in multiple tables.
Define calculated columns and measures as needed to calculate your metrics.
Use the Power Query Editor to clean and transform your data if required.

Create Visualizations:
Drag and drop visuals onto your report canvas.
Configure the visuals by adding fields to the Values, Axis, and Filters areas.
Customize visuals by adding titles, data labels, legends, and other formatting options.

Build Metrics Visuals:
For each metric you want to display, create the appropriate visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts, bullet charts, gauges) based on the suggestions provided earlier.
Add slicers and filters for interactivity if needed.

Create a Dashboard:
Combine your visuals into a cohesive dashboard.
Arrange visuals on the report canvas to create a visually appealing and informative dashboard.

Implement Interactivity:
Use slicers and filters to allow users to interact with the data dynamically.
Create drill-through pages to provide detailed information for specific metrics or dimensions.

Data Insights:
Use tooltips, annotations, and text boxes to provide additional context and insights within your dashboard.
Highlight key findings and actionable insights based on your data analysis.

Testing:
Test your dashboard to ensure all visuals and interactive features work as expected.
Validate that the metrics and data are accurately represented.

Publish and Share:
Save your Power BI project.
Publish the report to the Power BI Service (online platform).
Share the report with stakeholders, either by sharing a link or embedding it in a website.

Scheduled Data Refresh:
Set up a scheduled data refresh if your data source is regularly updated.

Documentation:
Document the steps, calculations, and data sources used in your project for future reference.
